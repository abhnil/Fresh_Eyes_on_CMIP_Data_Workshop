# Fresh Eyes on CMIP Data Workshop 2026
This repository contains notebooks for the Fresh Eyes on CMIP Workshop on the CMIP6 dataset. 

# Getting Started
The notebooks cover:

- accessing the cmip6 dataset from different data sources.
- processing cmip6 data for analysis and visualisation.
- producing climate stripes from the accessed cmip6 dataset.

# Testing the code
You can run the code in these notebooks on your own machine without downloading any of the requirements using binder. Note - the code will be much slower on binder than on your own machine.
